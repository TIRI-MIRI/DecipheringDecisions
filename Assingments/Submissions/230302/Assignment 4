Q1.
Dominant strategy for Player 1:c
Dominant strategy for Player 2:2

Nash Equilibrium:(c, 2)
Inference:The dominant strategies coincide with the Nash equilibrium.

Q2.
Mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium:Both firms choose Strategy I with probability 0.5 and Strategy II with probability 0.5
Values:p=0.5,q=0.5


Q3.
(a)Nash Equilibrium quantities:
q₁=q₂=(a−1)/(3b)

(b) Cartel quantities:
q₁=q₂=(a−1)/(4b)

This is not a Nash equilibrium.

(c) Better strategy:
Cartel yields higher profit but is unstable and not self-enforcing; operating independently is stable
